Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree - The Backend: Databases & Applications - Log Analysis Project


Database being looked at is newsdata.sql, available here: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip

Follow these instructions to install VM and Vagrant to implement this database and run queries on it: https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/8d3e23e1-9ab6-47eb-b4f3-d5dc7ef27bf0/modules/bc51d967-cb21-46f4-90ea-caf73439dc59/lessons/5475ecd6-cfdb-4418-85a2-f2583074c08d/concepts/14c72fe3-e3fe-4959-9c4b-467cf5b7c3a0

All queries are in log_analysis.py

Before running queries, please run create_views() to create views upon which top_authors() and bad_responses() are dependent.

Note: Having nearly all of the lesson be in just SQL and then making the project be python/psycopg2 is really frustrating and confusing. I was NOT adequately prepapred to do this with psycopg2.
